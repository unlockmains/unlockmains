    "The pursuit of knowledge is not a race, but a journey; each step brings new light to the unknown.",
    "The road to mastery begins with a single question: ‘What more can I learn today?",
    "Your future is shaped by the actions you take today. Don’t wait for the right time, create it.",
    "Success is not the destination, but the courage to continue on the journey. Embrace every step as part of your evolution.",
    "Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go they merely determine where you start.",
    "Man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit."
